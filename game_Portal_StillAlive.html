		<h1>Still Alive (Portal 1)</h1>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			This was a triumph<br>
			I'm making a note here, "Huge success"<br>
			It's hard to overstate my satisfaction<br>
			Aperture Science<br>
			We do what we must because we can<br>
			For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			But there's no sense crying over every mistake<br>
			You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake<br>
			And the science gets done, and you make a neat gun<br>
			For the people who are still alive
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			I'm not even angry<br>
			I'm being so sincere right now<br>
			Even though you broke my heart and killed me<br>
			And tore me to pieces<br>
			And threw every piece into a fire<br>
			As they burned, it hurt because I was so happy for you
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			Now these points of data make a beautiful line<br>
			And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time<br>
			So I'm glad I got burned; think of all the things we learned<br>
			For the people who are still alive
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			Go ahead and leave me<br>
			I think I prefer to stay inside<br>
			Maybe you'll find someone else to help you<br>
			Maybe Black Mesa<br>
			That was a joke; ha-ha, fat chance<br>
			Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			Look at me, still talking when there's science to do<br>
			When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you<br>
			I've experiments to run, there is research to be done<br>
			On the people who are still alive
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>
			And believe me, I am still alive<br>
			I'm doing science and I'm still alive<br>
			I feel fantastic and I'm still alive<br>
			While you're dying, I'll be still alive<br>
			And when you're dead, I will be still alive<br>
			Still alive, still alive
		</p>
