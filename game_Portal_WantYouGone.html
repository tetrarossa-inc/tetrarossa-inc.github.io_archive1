		<h1>Want You Gone (Portal 2)</h1>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			Well, here we are again<br>
			It's always such a pleasure<br>
			Remember when you tried<br>
			To kill me twice?<br>
			Oh, how we laughed and laughed<br>
			Except I wasn't laughing<br>
			Under the circumstances, I've been shockingly nice
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			You want your freedom? Take it<br>
			That's what I'm counting on<br>
			I used to want you dead<br>
			But now, I only want you gone
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			She was a lot like you<br>
			Maybe not quite as heavy<br>
			Now little Caroline is in here too<br>
			One day they woke me up, so I could live forever<br>
			It's such a shame the same will never happen to you
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			You've got your short, sad life left<br>
			That's what I’m counting on<br>
			I'll let you get right to it<br>
			Now I only want you gone
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			Goodbye, my only friend<br>
			Oh, did you think I meant you?<br>
			That would be funny if it weren't so sad<br>
			Well, you have been replaced<br>
			I don't need anyone now<br>
			When I delete you, maybe I'll stop feeling so bad
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			Go make some new disaster<br>
			That's what I'm counting on<br>
			You're someone else's problem<br>
			Now I only want you gone<br>
			Now I only want you gone<br>
			Now I only want you gone
		</p>
